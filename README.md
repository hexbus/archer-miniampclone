# archer-miniampclone
This is a clone of the old Archer 277-1008 mini amplifier PCB that Radio Shack used to sell.  This is of my design.  The last time I build these with OSH park, they worked.  BOM will be coming shortly.

Please feel free to use it and expand upon it.  The schematic (original one) is included.
